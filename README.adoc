== What is mo11y?

An observability solution designed for small-scale projects. Most observability tools are built for large-scale production systems. mo11y is built for personal projects, side projects, and small applications that don't need enterprise-grade complexity.

== Status

Currently in planning and design phase.

== Documentation

* link:docs/adr/index.adoc[Architectural Decision Records] - Technical decisions and their rationale
* link:docs/design/index.adoc[Design Documents] - Detailed component and feature designs
* link:docs/references/[References] - External specifications and protocols

== Philosophy

Small-scale projects deserve thoughtful observability without the overhead of tools designed for massive scale. mo11y aims to provide meaningful insights with minimal setup and resource usage.

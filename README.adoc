= mo11y

OTLP-native observability backend powered by DuckDB's analytical engine. Built for side projects and small-scale deployments where running Jaeger, Prometheus, and Loki is overkill.

Receives traces, logs, and metrics via standard OpenTelemetry protocol. Stores everything in a single embedded database. Query with SQL.

**m**ini + **o11y** (observability) = **mo11y** (pronounced "molly")

This directory contains detailed design documents for mo11y features and components.
Design docs explore implementation details, APIs, data models, and system interactions.

== When to Write a Design Doc
* Before implementing a major feature
* When designing APIs or interfaces
* For complex components requiring detailed planning
* When multiple implementation approaches need evaluation

== Naming Convention
`feature-name-design.adoc` or `component-name-design.adoc`

Example: `metrics-collection-design.adoc`

== Typical Structure
* *Overview*: What are we building?
* *Goals & Non-Goals*: Scope boundaries
* *Design*: Architecture, data models, APIs
* *Alternatives Considered*: Other approaches and why they weren't chosen
* *Open Questions*: Unresolved issues
